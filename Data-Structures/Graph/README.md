# GRAPH

Implement a Graph.

## CHALLENGE

Implement a Graph;\
The graph should be represented as an adjacency list that includes the following:

AddEdge()
- Adds a new vertice to the graphs
- Include the ability to have a “weight”
- Bring in both the parent node, and the new node to be added

GetNodes()
- returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection

GetNeighbors()
- returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
- Bring in a given node
- Include the weight from the given node.

Size()
- returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## SOLUTION
