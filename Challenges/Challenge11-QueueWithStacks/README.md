# Queue with Stacks

Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

## Challenge

Create a new Queue class. Using two Stack instances, implement this Queue with the following methods:

* enqueue(value) which inserts value into the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.
* dequeue() which extracts a value from the Queue using a first-in, first-out approach.

The Stack instances have only push and pop methods, and a size property. 
Instantiate these Stack objects in the Queue constructor.

## Solution
