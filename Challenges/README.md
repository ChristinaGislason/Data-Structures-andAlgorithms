# Challenges

This repository consists of daily challenges. 
Each challenge will have a whiteboard image of my approach in addition to the actual code implementation.

## Challenge 1

This application runs a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added.
It returns an array with the new value added at the middle index.
