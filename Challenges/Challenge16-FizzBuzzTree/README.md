# Fizz Buzz Tree

Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. 
Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value.

## Challenge

Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods, determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, 
and change the value of each of the nodes respectively. Return the tree with its news values.
Instead of changing the values of the nodes, output to the console the new values respectively.
